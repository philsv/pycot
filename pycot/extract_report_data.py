class COT:
    """
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) publishes the Commitments of Traders (COT) reports to help the public understand market dynamics.
    Specifically, the COT reports provide a breakdown of each Tuesdays open interest for futures and options on futures markets
    in which 20 or more traders hold positions equal to or above the reporting levels established by the CFTC.

    The COT reports are based on position data supplied by reporting firms (FCMs, clearing members, foreign brokers and exchanges).
    While the position data is supplied by reporting firms, the actual trader category or classification is based on the predominant business purpose self-reported
    by traders on the CFTC Form 40 and is subject to review by CFTC staff for reasonableness.

    CFTC staff does not know specific reasons for traders positions and hence this information does not factor in determining trader classifications.
    In practice this means, for example, that the position data for a trader classified in the `producer/merchant/processor/user` category for a particular commodity will include all of its positions in that commodity,
    regardless of whether the position is for hedging or speculation.
