## Contract Names

The only tricky part is the contract name.

You can find the contract name in the [CFTC Commitment of Traders](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm) reports. The contract name is the first column in the report.

You can also find a curated list of contract names in the [contract_names.json](https://github.com/philsv/pycot/tree/main/pycot/data/contract_names.json)

## Release Shedule
